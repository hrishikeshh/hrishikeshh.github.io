Hi there👋🏻,

I'm working at the crossroads of helping machines learn visually and verbally, so they can help us solve our problems more efficiently.

My research interests involve `deep learning`, `reinforcement learning`, `computer vision` in `GIS` and `finance`.

Kindly reach out if I can be of any help to you.

    <p><em>"The <b>Internet</b> is <b>self-destructing paper</b>. A place where anything written is soon destroyed by rapacious competition and the only preservation is to forever copy writing from sheet to sheet faster than they can burn.</em></p>
    <p><em>If it’s <b>worth writing</b>, it’s <b>worth keeping</b>. If it can be kept, it might be worth writing.</em></p>
    <p><em>If you store your writing on a third party site like Blogger, LiveJournal or even on your own site, but in the complex format used by blog/wiki software du jour you will lose it forever as soon as hypersonic wings of Internet labor flows direct people’s energies elsewhere.</em></p>
    <p><em>For most information published on the Internet, perhaps that is not a moment too soon, but how can the muse of originality soar when immolating transience brushes every feather?"</em></p>
