Hi there,

I'm $$Hrishikesh~Singh$$ <span onclick="document.getElementById('pronunciation').play()" style="cursor: pointer;"> (*pronunciation*:üîä) </span> and I help machines learn visually and verbally, so they can help us solve our problems more efficiently.

My research interests involve `deep learning`, `reinforcement learning`, *in* `computer vision`, `game-theory` and `natural-language-processing`.

Currently working on `IRSTD` *i.e.* Infrared Small Target Detection *and* financial `portfolio-optimization` problems. 

Kindly reach out if I can be of any help to you.
