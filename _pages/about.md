Hey, thanks for stopping by! üëã

I'm **Hrishikesh Singh** <span onclick="document.getElementById('pronunciation').play()" style="cursor: pointer;"> (*pronunciation*:üîä) </span> and I help machines learn visually and verbally, so they can help us solve our problems more efficiently.

My research interests involve `deep learning`, `reinforcement learning`, *in* `computer vision`, `game-theory` and `natural-language-processing`.

Currently working on Infrared Small Target Detection (`IRSTD`) *and* financial `portfolio-optimization` problems.

Kindly reach out if I can be of any help to you.
