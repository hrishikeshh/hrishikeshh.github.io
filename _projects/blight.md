[Early blight](https://ipm.cahnr.uconn.edu/early-blight-and-late-blight-of-potato/) and [late blight](https://extension.umn.edu/disease-management/late-blight), two serious diseases of potato, are widely distributed. We are detecting the stage of the blight using deep learning to help farmers take appropriate preventive actions.
