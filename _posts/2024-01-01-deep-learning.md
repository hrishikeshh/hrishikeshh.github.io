        <h3>Dive into Deep Learning</h3>
        <p><u>Good Part</u>: This books is really comprehensive with a perfect balance between theory and code to keep your <i>FOMO</i> in check while following this resource. Covers the theory implementation using both, TensorFlow and PyTorch. There is an open-sourced handy <a href="https://d2l.ai/index.html">web-version</a> as well as PDF. </p>
        <p><u>Bad Part</u>: Quite exhaustive, if you are looking for something to be completed in a week.</p>

        <h3>Deep Learning with Python</h3>
        <p>I completed this book before above one and this gave me a more intuitive understanding of Deep Learning Landscape. Short and crisp introduction to basics and then branching into computer vision and NLP.</p>
