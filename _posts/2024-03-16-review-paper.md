## Structure of Paper

- Abstract (4 sentence)
- Introduction (1 page)
  - Use forward reference from the narrative in the introduction.
  - State your contributions upfront so the readers won't have to guess
- The Problem (1 page)
  
- Our idea (2 page)
  - In a paper your MUST provide the details, but FIRST convey the idea.
  - Conveying the intuition is primary, never secondary.
- The details (5 pages)
- Related work (1-2 pages)
- Conclusions and future work (0.5 pages)
 

### Abstract

- Write the abstract the last and it should be writing keeping in mind that reader decides if they want to read further, just by reading abstract.
- Abstract should focus on 4 part specifically (Recommended by Kent Beck):-
  1. State the problem
  2. Say why it's an interesting problem
  3. Say what your solution achieves
  4. Say what follows from your solution

Three readers = You, your supervisor and the reviewer.

### Introduction

- Introduce the problem with an example (better if it's a real world example).
- You could have mentioned the problem in an abstract way but make it little bit more concrete by example in the introduction

### The Problem

### Our Idea

### The details

### Related Work

### Conclusions and future Work
