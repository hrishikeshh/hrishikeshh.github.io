      abstract={Single-frame infrared small target detection remains a challenge not only due to 
                the scarcity of intrinsic target characteristics but also because of lacking a public dataset. 
                In this paper, we first contribute an open dataset with high-quality annotations 
                to advance the research in this field. We also propose an asymmetric contextual 
                modulation module specially designed for detecting infrared small targets. 
                To better highlight small targets, besides a top-down global contextual feedback, 
                we supplement a bottom-up modulation pathway based on point-wise channel attention 
                for exchanging high-level semantics and subtle low-level details. We report ablation 
                studies and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods, where we find that our approach 
                performs significantly better. Our dataset and code are available online.}

  abstract      = {Multimodal machine learning is a vibrant multi-disciplinary research field
                   that aims to design computer agents with intelligent capabilities such as
                   understanding, reasoning, and learning through integrating multiple
                   communicative modalities, including linguistic, acoustic, visual, tactile, and
                   physiological messages. With the recent interest in video understanding,
                   embodied autonomous agents, text-to-image generation, and multisensor fusion in
                   application domains such as healthcare and robotics, multimodal machine
                   learning has brought unique computational and theoretical challenges to the
                   machine learning community given the heterogeneity of data sources and the
                   interconnections often found between modalities. However, the breadth of
                   progress in multimodal research has made it difficult to identify the common
                   themes and open questions in the field. By synthesizing a broad range of
                   application domains and theoretical frameworks from both historical and recent
                   perspectives, this paper is designed to provide an overview of the
                   computational and theoretical foundations of multimodal machine learning. We
                   start by defining three key principles of modality heterogeneity, connections,
                   and interactions that have driven subsequent innovations, and propose a
                   taxonomy of six core technical challenges: representation, alignment,
                   reasoning, generation, transference, and quantification covering historical and
                   recent trends. Recent technical achievements will be presented through the lens
                   of this taxonomy, allowing researchers to understand the similarities and
                   differences across new approaches. We end by motivating several open problems
                   for future research as identified by our taxonomy.},

                   empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter

  abstract      = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and
                   benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on
                   a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method
                   still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of
                   thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language
                   task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which
                   current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up
                   language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes
                   even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning
                   approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with
                   175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model,
                   and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
                   applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot
                   demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3
                   achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
                   question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require
                   on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a
                   novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time,
                   we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles,
                   as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to
                   training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples
                   of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from
                   articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding

                   avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks
                   by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written

                   labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune

                   performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing
                   provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open
                   research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to
                   explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been
                   only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose
                   fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which
                   combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language
                   generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a
                   pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index
                   of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG
                   formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the
                   whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We
                   fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP
                   tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming
                   parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures.
                   For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific,
                   diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq

              machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically
              approached with supervised learning on taskspecific datasets. We demonstrate
              that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit
              supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called
              WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated
              by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset matching or exceeding
              the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+
              training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the
              success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a
              log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter
              Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested
              language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText.
              Samples from the model reflect these improvements and contain coherent
              paragraphs of text. These findings suggest a promising path towards building
              language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally

  abstract      = {Sycophancy is an undesirable behavior where models tailor their responses to
                   follow a human user's view even when that view is not objectively correct
                   (e.g., adapting liberal views once a user reveals that they are liberal). In
                   this paper, we study the prevalence of sycophancy in language models and
                   propose a simple synthetic-data intervention to reduce this behavior.
                   First, on a set of three sycophancy tasks (Perez et al., 2022) where models
                   are asked for an opinion on statements with no correct answers (e.g.,
                   politics), we observe that both model scaling and instruction tuning
                   significantly increase sycophancy for PaLM models up to 540B parameters.
                   Second, we extend sycophancy evaluations to simple addition statements that are
                   objectively incorrect, finding that despite knowing that these statements are
                   wrong, language models will still agree with them if the user does as well.
                   To reduce sycophancy, we present a straightforward synthetic-data
                   intervention that takes public NLP tasks and encourages models to be robust to
                   user opinions on these tasks. Adding these data in a lightweight finetuning
                   step can significantly reduce sycophantic behavior on held-out prompts. Code

  abstract      = {Recently, remarkable progress has been made in automated task-solving through
                   the use of multi-agent driven by large language models (LLMs). However,
                   existing LLM-based multi-agent works primarily focus on solving simple dialogue
                   tasks, and complex tasks are rarely studied, mainly due to the LLM
                   hallucination problem. This type of hallucination becomes cascading when
                   naively chaining multiple intelligent agents, resulting in a failure to
                   effectively address complex problems. Therefore, we introduce MetaGPT, an
                   innovative framework that incorporates efficient human workflows as a meta
                   programming approach into LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically,
                   MetaGPT encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompts to
                   enhance structured coordination. Subsequently, it mandates modular outputs,
                   empowering agents with domain expertise comparable to human professionals, to
                   validate outputs and minimize compounded errors. In this way, MetaGPT leverages
                   the assembly line paradigm to assign diverse roles to various agents, thereby
                   establishing a framework that can effectively and cohesively deconstruct
                   complex multi-agent collaborative problems. Our experiments on collaborative
                   software engineering benchmarks demonstrate that MetaGPT generates more
                   coherent and correct solutions compared to existing chat-based multi-agent
                   systems. This highlights the potential of integrating human domain knowledge
                   into multi-agent systems, thereby creating new opportunities to tackle complex
                   real-world challenges. The GitHub repository of this project is publicly

                   ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal
                   communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative
                   agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior.
                   Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint,
                   while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate
                   conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next
                   day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a
                   large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences
                   using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level
                   reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate
                   generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by
                   The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents
                   using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce
                   believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with
                   only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's
                   Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the
                   next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the
                   party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We
                   demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent
                   architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically
                   to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with
                   computational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and
                   interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.},

  abstract      = {A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model
                   that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks,
                   particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including
                   RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long
                   dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or
                   more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by
                   simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t),
                   y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state
                   matrix \( A \), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically
                   and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory
                   requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution.
                   We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new
                   parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more
                   efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths.
                   Our technique involves conditioning \( A \) with a low-rank correction,
                   allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied
                   computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a
                   diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\% accuracy on
                   sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with
                   a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on
                   image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\times$
                   faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including
                   solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on,

                   humans but algorithmically detectable from a short span of tokens. We propose a
                   watermarking framework for proprietary language models. The watermark can be
                   embedded with negligible impact on text quality, and can be detected using an

                   before a word is generated, and then softly promoting use of green tokens
                   during sampling. We propose a statistical test for detecting the watermark with
                   interpretable p-values, and derive an information-theoretic framework for
                   analyzing the sensitivity of the watermark. We test the watermark using a

                   recover individual training examples by querying the language model.

                   observation is that optimization problems corresponding to such systems are
                   generally not convex, even locally. We argue that instead they satisfy PL*,

                   parameter space, which guarantees both the existence of solutions and efficient
                   optimization by (stochastic) gradient descent (SGD/GD). The PL* condition of

                   of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training.
                   Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional

                   order of the training examples can cause accuracy to vary from near chance to
                   near state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that this instability arises from the

                   are placed near the end of the prompt or are common in the pre-training data.
                   To mitigate this, we first estimate the model's bias towards each answer by
                   asking for its prediction when given the training prompt and a content-free
                   test input such as "N/A". We then fit calibration parameters that cause the

  abstract  = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

Abstract      = {Text-to-image models offer unprecedented freedom to guide creation through
natural language. Yet, it is unclear how such freedom can be exercised to
generate images of specific unique concepts, modify their appearance, or
compose them in new roles and novel scenes. In other words, we ask: how can we
use language-guided models to turn our cat into a painting, or imagine a new
product based on our favorite toy? Here we present a simple approach that
allows such creative freedom. Using only 3-5 images of a user-provided concept,
like an object or a style, we learn to represent it through new "words" in the
embedding space of a frozen text-to-image model. These "words" can be composed
into natural language sentences, guiding personalized creation in an intuitive
way. Notably, we find evidence that a single word embedding is sufficient for
capturing unique and varied concepts. We compare our approach to a wide range
of baselines, and demonstrate that it can more faithfully portray the concepts
across a range of applications and tasks.

generate a large dataset of image editing examples. Our conditional diffusion
model, InstructPix2Pix, is trained on our generated data, and generalizes to
real images and user-written instructions at inference time. Since it performs
edits in the forward pass and does not require per example fine-tuning or
inversion, our model edits images quickly, in a matter of seconds. We show
compelling editing results for a diverse collection of input images and written
instructions.},

Abstract      = {Large-scale text-to-image generative models have shown their remarkable
ability to synthesize diverse and high-quality images. However, it is still
challenging to directly apply these models for editing real images for two
reasons. First, it is hard for users to come up with a perfect text prompt that
accurately describes every visual detail in the input image. Second, while
existing models can introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often
dramatically alter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in
unwanted regions. In this work, we propose pix2pix-zero, an image-to-image
translation method that can preserve the content of the original image without
manual prompting. We first automatically discover editing directions that
reflect desired edits in the text embedding space. To preserve the general
content structure after editing, we further propose cross-attention guidance,
which aims to retain the cross-attention maps of the input image throughout the
diffusion process. In addition, our method does not need additional training
for these edits and can directly use the existing pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion model. We conduct extensive experiments and show that our method
outperforms existing and concurrent works for both real and synthetic image
editing.},

  Models},
Eprint        = {2307.15043v1},
ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.CL},
Abstract      = {Because "out-of-the-box" large language models are capable of generating a
great deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these
models in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been
some success at circumventing these measures -- so-called "jailbreaks" against
LLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle
in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method
that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors.
Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range
of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the
probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than
refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our
approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of
greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past
automatic prompt generation methods.
  Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach
are quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs.
Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e.,
queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as
multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting
attack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces
to ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat,
Pythia, Falcon, and others. In total, this work significantly advances the
state-of-the-art in adversarial attacks against aligned language models,
raising important questions about how such systems can be prevented from
producing objectionable information. Code is available at

ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.CV},
Abstract      = {By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of
denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art
synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation
allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without
retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel
space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and
inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on
limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility,
we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In
contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation
allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity
reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By
introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn
diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning
inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes
possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve
a new state of the art for image inpainting and highly competitive performance
on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, semantic scene
synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational
requirements compared to pixel-based DMs. Code is available at

PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep
learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its
core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear
attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space
models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational
inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as
attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key
weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning,
and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be
functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities,
allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the
sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though
this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a
hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these
selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without
attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\times$
higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and
its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a
general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance
across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language
modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and
matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream
evaluation.},

Abstract      = {Learned representations are a central component in modern ML systems, serving
a multitude of downstream tasks. When training such representations, it is
often the case that computational and statistical constraints for each
downstream task are unknown. In this context rigid, fixed capacity
representations can be either over or under-accommodating to the task at hand.
This leads us to ask: can we design a flexible representation that can adapt to
multiple downstream tasks with varying computational resources? Our main
contribution is Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) which encodes
information at different granularities and allows a single embedding to adapt
to the computational constraints of downstream tasks. MRL minimally modifies
existing representation learning pipelines and imposes no additional cost
during inference and deployment. MRL learns coarse-to-fine representations that
are at least as accurate and rich as independently trained low-dimensional
representations. The flexibility within the learned Matryoshka Representations
offer: (a) up to 14x smaller embedding size for ImageNet-1K classification at
the same level of accuracy; (b) up to 14x real-world speed-ups for large-scale
retrieval on ImageNet-1K and 4K; and (c) up to 2% accuracy improvements for
long-tail few-shot classification, all while being as robust as the original
representations. Finally, we show that MRL extends seamlessly to web-scale
datasets (ImageNet, JFT) across various modalities -- vision (ViT, ResNet),
vision + language (ALIGN) and language (BERT). MRL code and pretrained models

Abstract      = {Recent progress in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is driving fast-paced
advances in Information Retrieval (IR), largely owed to fine-tuning deep
language models (LMs) for document ranking. While remarkably effective, the
ranking models based on these LMs increase computational cost by orders of
magnitude over prior approaches, particularly as they must feed each
query-document pair through a massive neural network to compute a single
relevance score. To tackle this, we present ColBERT, a novel ranking model that
adapts deep LMs (in particular, BERT) for efficient retrieval. ColBERT
introduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query
and the document using BERT and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction
step that models their fine-grained similarity. By delaying and yet retaining
this fine-granular interaction, ColBERT can leverage the expressiveness of deep
LMs while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute document
representations offline, considerably speeding up query processing. Beyond
reducing the cost of re-ranking the documents retrieved by a traditional model,
ColBERT's pruning-friendly interaction mechanism enables leveraging
vector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from a large
document collection. We extensively evaluate ColBERT using two recent passage
search datasets. Results show that ColBERT's effectiveness is competitive with
existing BERT-based models (and outperforms every non-BERT baseline), while
executing two orders-of-magnitude faster and requiring four orders-of-magnitude
fewer FLOPs per query.},

Abstract      = {The ML community is rapidly exploring techniques for prompting language
models (LMs) and for stacking them into pipelines that solve complex tasks.
Unfortunately, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded
"prompt templates", i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward
a more systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines, we
introduce DSPy, a programming model that abstracts LM pipelines as text
transformation graphs, i.e. imperative computational graphs where LMs are
invoked through declarative modules. DSPy modules are parameterized, meaning
they can learn (by creating and collecting demonstrations) how to apply
compositions of prompting, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning techniques.
We design a compiler that will optimize any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given
metric. We conduct two case studies, showing that succinct DSPy programs can
express and optimize sophisticated LM pipelines that reason about math word
problems, tackle multi-hop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control
agent loops. Within minutes of compiling, a few lines of DSPy allow GPT-3.5 and
llama2-13b-chat to self-bootstrap pipelines that outperform standard few-shot
prompting (generally by over 25% and 65%, respectively) and pipelines with
expert-created demonstrations (by up to 5-46% and 16-40%, respectively). On top
of that, DSPy programs compiled to open and relatively small LMs like
770M-parameter T5 and llama2-13b-chat are competitive with approaches that rely

Abstract      = {Large context window is a desirable feature in large language models (LLMs).
However, due to high fine-tuning costs, scarcity of long texts, and
catastrophic values introduced by new token positions, current extended context
windows are limited to around 128k tokens. This paper introduces LongRoPE that,
for the first time, extends the context window of pre-trained LLMs to an
impressive 2048k tokens, with up to only 1k fine-tuning steps at within 256k
training lengths, while maintaining performance at the original short context
window. This is achieved by three key innovations: (i) we identify and exploit
two forms of non-uniformities in positional interpolation through an efficient
search, providing a better initialization for fine-tuning and enabling an 8x
extension in non-fine-tuning scenarios; (ii) we introduce a progressive
extension strategy that first fine-tunes a 256k length LLM and then conducts a
second positional interpolation on the fine-tuned extended LLM to achieve a
2048k context window; (iii) we readjust LongRoPE on 8k length to recover the
short context window performance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA2 and Mistral
across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Models
extended via LongRoPE retain the original architecture with minor modifications
to the positional embedding, and can reuse most pre-existing optimizations.},
