> *"Writing is nature's way of showing you that how fuzzy your thinking is...."* -- Cartoonist Seth

You don't understand something until you have written it down, carefully enough to explain it to somebody else.

> *"The **Internet** is **self-destructing paper**. A place where anything written is soon destroyed by rapacious competition and the only preservation is to forever copy writing from sheet to sheet faster than they can burn."*
> *If it’s **worth writing**, it’s **worth keeping**. If it can be kept, it might be worth writing.*
> *If you store your writing on a third party site like Blogger, LiveJournal or even on your own site, but in the complex format used by blog/wiki software du jour you will lose it forever as soon as hypersonic wings of Internet labor flows direct people’s energies elsewhere.*
> *For most information published on the Internet, perhaps that is not a moment too soon, but how can the muse of originality soar when immolating transience brushes every feather?*
>--[**Julian Assange**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange) (“Self destructing paper”, 2006-12-05)
